# RxActivity
Let's use `Activity#startActivityForResult` and `Activity#requestPermission` in Reactive way

## Requirements
- Knowledge of RxJava2
- Know why [OnActivityResult](http://developer.android.com/intl/es/training/basics/intents/result.html) is [breaking something](http://blog.danlew.net/2015/03/02/dont-break-the-chain/).

## Usage
- Find your `startActivityForResult` logic and change it like following:

```java
// Before
startActivityForResult(intent, MY_REQUEST_CODE);

// After (Sorry, but we need a dependency to context)
RxActivity.startActivityForResult(context, intent);
```

- Migrate your `onActivityResult` callbacks into `subscribe` after `RxActivity#startActivityForResult`:

```java
// Before
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    if (MY_REQUEST_CODE == requestCode && Activity.RESULT_OK == resultCode) {
        // ... result handling ...
    }
}

// After
RxActivity.startActivityForResult(context, intent)
    .subscribe((Pair<Integer, Intent>) result -> {
        if (Activity.RESULT_OK == result.first) {
            // ... result handling ...
        }
    });
```

## Development background - tl;dr
As ReactiveX and MVP design pattern is introduced and adopted by many Android developers, chances of calling `startActivityForResult` or `requestPermission` at View logic are increasing which are not `Activity` or `Fragment`s.

Sadly, Android platform is not offering us easy mechanism to write callback logic near those result-requesting methods, thus it forcing us to break Reactive chaining. Let's see an example of the situation below:

```java
public class MyFriendsListActivity extends Activity {
    /*
     * This Activity takes multiple responsibilities thus we separated
     * related tasks as View and Presenter.
     */
    private FriendListPresenter friendListPresenter;
    // ... many other presenters ...
    private CameraPresenter     cameraPresenter;
        
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        this.friendListPresenter = new FriendListPresenter(new FriendListView(this));
        // ... many other presenters ...
        this.cameraPresenter     = new CameraPresenter(new CameraView(this));
    }
    
    /* ... maybe hundreds of codes ... */
    
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        if (Activity.RESULT_OK == resultCode) {
            switch(requestCode) {
                case CameraView.REQUEST_CODE_TAKE_PHOTO:
                    /* 
                     * This method will make our cameraPresenter a bit cohesive 
                     * unless we handle the result directly at here
                     */
                    cameraPresenter.onActivityResult(resultCode, data);
            }
        }
    }
}
    
class CameraView {  /* ... some initialisation codes ... */  }
    
class CameraPresenter {
    // Must not be same across all presenters used in MyFriendListActivity
    static final int REQUEST_CODE_TAKE_PHOTO = 9999;
    
    CameraPresenter(CameraView cameraView) {
        cameraView.getTakePhotoButton().setOnClickListener(view -> {
            Context uiContext = view.getContext();
            Intent intent = new Intent(uiContext, CameraActivity.class);
            /*
             * Now, if we wonder how this result is handled,
             * we must search whole onActivityResult methods that are
             * using REQUEST_CODE_TAKE_PHOTO. 
             * 
             * Even if we don't using `goto`s, this mechanism makes
             * same effect - forcing us to make spaghetti code!
             */
            uiContext.startActivityForResult(intent, REQUEST_CODE_TAKE_PHOTO);
        });
    }
    
    /*
     * Maybe we can guess this method will be called after 'taking photo' 
     * is finished. However, if we want to ENSURE that will be happen,
     * we have to track down that which logic in somewhere actually calls this.
     */
    void onActivityResult(int resultCode, Intent data) {
        if (Activity.RESULT_OK == resultCode) {
            // ....
        }
    }
}
```

MyFriendListActivity contains many features and complex since it's a business requirement and a developer want to reduce its complexity, he/she bound logic as Presenter-View form. Let's have a look of an arbitary logic that invokes external camera  and handling its result.

Blame to the dependency between `startActivityForResult` - `onActivityResult` methods, now the developer wrote a spaghetti code without using any `goto`s. `requestPermissions` - `onRequestPermissionsResult` pair is not that much different although we did not demonstrated it in the code above. ðŸ˜¡

Another tidious thing is we have to manage all `requestCode` values are not duplicate all over presenters bound to same Activity - `MyFriendsListActivity`, in this case.

RxActivity is made to mitigate this awkwardnesses.

## How can we make this more greater
Rewriting the example code with RxActivity will be as follows:

```java
public class MyFriendsListActivity extends Activity {
    /*
     * This Activity takes multiple responsibilities thus we separated
     * related tasks as View and Presenter.
     */
    private FriendListPresenter friendListPresenter;
    // ... many other presenters ...
    private CameraPresenter     cameraPresenter;
        
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        this.friendListPresenter = new FriendListPresenter(new FriendListView(this));
        // ... many other presenters ...
        this.cameraPresenter     = new CameraPresenter(new CameraView(this));
    }
    
    /* ... maybe hundreds of codes ... */
    // we don' need onActivityResult inheritance anymore
}
    
class CameraView {  /* ... some initialisation codes ... */  }
    
class CameraPresenter {
    CameraPresenter(CameraView cameraView) {
        View getTakePhotoButton = cameraView.getTakePhotoButton();
        Context uiContext = getTakePhotoButton.getContext();
        /*
         * Now we can see request and result handling logic are tied together at
         * same place. A bonus is we don't need to manage request codes any further!
         */
        Intent intent = new Intent(uiContext, CameraActivity.class);
        RxActivity.startActivityForResult(uiContext, intent)
            .subscribe((Pair<Integer, Intent>) result -> {
                int resultCode = result.first;
                Intent data = result.second;
  		        if (Activity.RESULT_OK == resultCode) {
		            // ....
		        }
            })
            .takeUntil(ActivityLifeCycles.ON_DESTROY);
    }
}
```

As we can see, we don't need to shit around with any `onActivityResult`s anymore. Code is much shorter too! ðŸ˜„
